## Types of construction
### 2-Wheel Construction

The 2-wheel construction is a popular and widely used design in AILite projects. It is favored for its simplicity, agility, and versatility, making it suitable for a broad range of applications. This design features two wheels driven by motors, allowing for straightforward movement and maneuverability. The 2-wheel version is especially well-suited for projects that require quick directional changes, precise navigation, and efficient use of space.

Key Features:
Versatility: The 2-wheel construction can be applied to a wide variety of projects, ranging from basic robotics to more complex automation tasks.
Agility: With only two wheels, this design allows for easy turning and swift movement, making it ideal for navigating tight spaces and performing tasks that require quick adjustments.
Simplicity: The design is simple, making it easier to build, maintain, and modify for different project needs.

### 4-Wheel Construction

The 4-wheel construction in AILite provides a more stable and robust platform, which is particularly advisable for projects involving color sensors and other sensor-based applications. While the same projects that can be performed with the 2-wheel version can also be executed with the 4-wheel version, the latter offers added stability and support, which is crucial for certain types of sensor-based tasks.

Key Features:
Stability: The 4-wheel design offers greater stability, reducing the risk of tipping or imbalance, especially when navigating uneven terrain or carrying additional sensors and equipment.
Enhanced Sensor Performance: For color sensor-based projects, the 4-wheel construction provides a steadier platform, ensuring more accurate sensor readings and reliable performance.
Adaptability: Although more complex than the 2-wheel version, the 4-wheel construction can handle the same range of projects, with the added benefit of increased stability and sensor integration.

## Various Execution Options for AILite

In addition to MIT App Inventor, AILite projects can also be developed using Python, a powerful and user-friendly platform for creating mobile applications. MIT App Inventor allows users to design and implement projects through a visual programming interface, making it accessible to those who may not be familiar with traditional coding.
